**** Sound maths and physics

*Simple interface of a synth*

*source:* A waveform (simple or complex)

arguments of a source i.e periodic oscillators

- frequency: (the cycles per second (Hz)),

- phase: starts at 0 means sine, starts at 1 means cosine

- amplitude: the distance between the top and the bottom of a wave.
  
*Envelope:* the shape of the sound intensity i.e
 - attack time (the starting point of an envelope measured in milliseconds), 
- sustain level(intesity, measured in deciBels)

To generate a sound you can experiment in
the SuperCollider environment.

On SuperCollider you can play a SinOsc UGEN as an audio rate sine
wavetable oscillator.
SinOsc uses the same implementation as Osc except that its table is
fixed to be a sine wave made of 8192 samples.

Example source and envelope:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
//SuperCollider WorkSpace
(
{
    var env = Env([0, 1, 0.5, 1, 0], [0.01, 0.5, 0.02, 0.5]);
    SinOsc.ar(470) * EnvGen.kr(env, doneAction: 2)
}.play
)
#+END_SRC

*Simple engineering tools*

- delay (temporal shift on the order of ms),
- eq (frequency spicific amplifier),
- compressor (automatic gain control)

Example SC:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
DelayL.ar(in: 0, maxdelaytime: 0.2, delaytime: 0.2, mul: 1, add: 0)//Simple delay line with linear interpolation

Compander.ar(in: 0, control: 0, thresh: 0.5, slopeBelow: 1, slopeAbove: 1, clampTime: 0.01, relaxTime: 0.1, mul: 1, add: 0)//Compressor, expander, limiter, gate, ducker

BPeakEQ.ar(in, freq: 1200, rq: 1, db: 0, mul: 1, add: 0)//Parametric equalizer

#+END_SRC
