**** Notation

*MIDI*

The lowest note musicians use is C-1, which has the MIDI number 0. The
number 12 = C0, 24 = C1, 36 = C2, 48 = C3, 60 = C4 (which is middle C
on the piano, remember this one), and so on. A 440 is above middle C
so it is 69.

60, 62, 63, 60, 66

*Frequencies*

It is the number of cycles (per second) of a periodic wave.
