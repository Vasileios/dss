**** Glossary

*Mathematics*


=premise= a statement that is assumed to be true.

=polynomial function= is an expression consisting of variables (also
called indeterminates) and coefficients, that i
nvolves only the
operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative
integer exponents of variables (Wiki, see more [[http://ebooks.edu.gr/modules/ebook/show.php/DSGL-B133/625/4028,18063/index4_1.html][here]])

*Physics*

=frequency= the number of times that a wave, especially a light, sound,
or radio wave, is produced within a particular period, especially one
second.

=amplitude= the distance between the top and the bottom of a wave.

=wave superposition= (systems theory) - /superposition principle/, see also Rolling motion,- is
when a wave traversing the same space with other waves. (the sum of
the amplitudes of any individual wave) 


*Computing-SC-sound synthesis*

=function= lamda calculus

=SC Function= a = { [100, 200, 300].choose };  

=SC Event= An Event is a =SC Environment= with a 'play' method. An Event specifies an action to be taken in response to a =-play= message.

=SC Pattern= creates a Stream that iterates an array.

=SC Stream= Streams represent sequences of values that are obtained one at a time.

=SC Pbind= The Event Pattern Class Pbind connects specific patterns with specific names. Consult its help page for details.

=wavetable= is a table with the amplitude values of a signal

*Music*

=motet= Form of polyphonic vocal music (12th century)
