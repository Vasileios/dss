* Algorithmic Composition

Algorithm is:

- A set of mathematical instructions that must be followed in a fixed
  order, and that, especially if given to a computer, will help to calculate an answer to a mathematical
problem.
-  A systematic procedure that produces â€“ in a finite number of steps
  the answer to a question or the solution of a problem.
- [...] (especially computing) a set of rules that must be followed
  when solving a particular problem. (Nierhaus 2009 p.2)
